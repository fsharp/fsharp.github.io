# The F# Language and Core Library RFC Process
{:.no_toc}

This post briefy mentions [the F# Language and Core Library RFC Process](https://github.com/fsharp/fslang-design/blob/master/README.md),
one of the activities of the FSSF Core Engineering Group.

Since 2015, development of the F# Language and Core Library has been using an RFC process.

1. Use [F# Language Suggestions](https://github.com/fsharp/fslang-suggestions/) to submit ideas, vote on them and discuss them.

2. Ideas which get "approved in principle" get an [RFC entry](https://github.com/fsharp/fslang-design/tree/master/RFCs) based on the [template](https://github.com/fsharp/fslang-design/blob/master/RFC_template.md), and a corresponding [RFC discussion thread](https://github.com/fsharp/fslang-design/issues)

3. Implementations and testing are usually submitted to the [visualfsharp](https://github.com/Microsoft/visualfsharp/) repository and then integrated to [fsharp](https://github.com/fsharp/fsharp) and  [FSharp.Compiler.Service](https://github.com/fsharp/FSharp.Compiler.Service)

Please contribute to this process, either by creating RFCs, commenting on the discussion threads,
sending pull requests to modify and clarify existing RFCs, or doing the implementation, testing and
documentation to help complete the RFCs.
